SDAPS Class and Package repository
==================================

This repository contains LaTeX classes and packages to create machine readable
questionnaires. Metadata is generated for the whole document and it is
possible to process created forms fully automatically using the SDAPS main
program.
As of now, this package is included in the SDAPS unstable (1.9.0) distribution.

Features
========

 * Flexible metadata generation
 * Different question types:
   - Freeform text
   - Multiple Choice Questions
     * may contain freeform text fields
       (TODO: some people would like a combined checkbox + textfield)
     * standalone
     * as a list (to be implemented)
     * array with questions in rows
     * array with questions in columns
   - Single Choice Qeustions:
     * standalone (to be implemented)
     * as a list (to be implemented)
     * array with questions in rows
     * array with questions in columns
   - Range (1-n answers with optionally further choices):
     * standalone
     * array with questions in rows
 * Array layout features (used for questions in arrays):
   - Can flow over multiple pages and repeats the header automatically
   - Optional document wide alignment of array environments
   - Has complex layout features like rotating the headers to safe space
   - Ability to exchange rows and columns on the fly
 * PDF form generation
 * Complex document wide and local setting handling
 * Possibility to pre-fill questionnaires directly in LaTeX
   (not yet easily usable by end users)

Documentation
=============

The most up to date documentation is in the sphinx directory. An online copy
can be found at http://sdaps.org/class-doc. The documentation in the files
is outdated at this point and likely to be stripped down rather than extended.
